Uses python to manage files easily, delete bulk files, rename entire folders, and loads more!

## How to use
Simply, download the quickedit.py file, and open it using Python.
Enter the following: "python quickstart.py"

Once it runs, it will open a simple prompt based system where you will respond with A, B, or C.
Make sure to enter the full folder name cd:example/example/folder - NOT just the folder name!
